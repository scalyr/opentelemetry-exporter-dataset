  **NOTES**
  - This change can expose cardinality issues where the counters were previously collapsed under the non-indexed instance name.
  - The change mimics Windows Performance Monitor behavior: The first instance name remains unchanged, additional instances are suffixed with `#<N>` where `N=1` and is increased for each duplicate.
    - e.g. Given 3 powershell instances, this will return `powershell`, `powershell#1` and `powershell#2`.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
