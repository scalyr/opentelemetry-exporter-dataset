The `sqlserver` receiver grabs metrics about a Microsoft SQL Server instance using the Windows Performance Counters.
Because of this, it is a Windows only receiver.

## Configuration

The following settings are optional:
- `collection_interval` (default = `10s`): The internal at which metrics should be emitted by this receiver.

To collect from a SQL Server with a named instance, both `computer_name` and `instance_name` are required. For a default SQL Server setup, these settings are optional.
- `computer_name` (optional): The computer name identifies the SQL Server name or IP address of the computer being monitored.
- `instance_name` (optional): The instance name identifies the specific SQL Server instance being monitored.

Example:

```yaml
    receivers:
      sqlserver:
        collection_interval: 10s
```

When a named instance is used, a computer name and a instance name must be specified.
Example with named instance:

```yaml
    receivers:
      sqlserver:
        collection_interval: 10s
        computer_name: CustomServer
        instance_name: CustomInstance
        resource_attributes:
          sqlserver.computer.name:
            enabled: true
          sqlserver.instance.name:
            enabled: true
```

The full list of settings exposed for this receiver are documented [here](./config.go) with detailed sample configurations [here](./testdata/config.yaml).

## Metrics

Details about the metrics produced by this receiver can be found in [documentation.md](./documentation.md)
