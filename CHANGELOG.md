## v0.83.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/k8scluster`: Unify predefined and custom node metrics. (#24776)
  - Update metrics description and units to be consistent
  - Remove predefined metrics definitions from metadata.yaml because they are controlled by `node_conditions_to_report` 
    and `allocatable_types_to_report` config options.
  
- `prometheusexporter`: Remove invalid unit translations from the prometheus exporters (#24647)
- `receiver/prometheusexec`: Removes the deprecated prometheus_exec receiver (#24740)

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `datadogconnector`: This is a new component that computes Datadog APM Stats in the event that trace pipelines are sampled. (#19740)
  This component replaces the Datadog processor
  
- `gitproviderreceiver`: Add the skeleton for the new gitproviderreceiver in development with accompanying github scraper. (#22028)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `azuredataexplorerexporter`: Add support for managed identity. This enables users to not use Key based authentication (#21924)
- `awsemfexporter`: Add awsemf.nodimrollupdefault feature gate to aws emf exporter (#23997)
  Enabling the awsemf.nodimrollupdefault will cause the AWS EMF Exporter to use the NoDimensionRollup configuration
  setting by default instead of ZeroAndSingleDimensionRollup.
  
- `awss3exporter`: add Sumo Logic Installed Collector marshaler (#23212)
- `receiver/collectdreceiver`: Migrate from opencensus to pdata, change collectd, test to match pdata format. (#20760)
- `datasetexporter`: Make duration of shutdown procedure configurable to minimise data losses. (#24415)
- `datasetexporter`: Make sure serverHost field is correctly and always populated on the DataSet events. For more information and available configuration options, please refer to the plugin readme file. (#20660, #24415)
- `datadogreceiver`: add datadog trace and span id (#23057)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add support for using addition and subtraction with time and duration (#22009)
- `transformprocessor`: Add extract_count_metric OTTL function to transform processor (#22853)
- `transformprocessor`: Add extract_sum_metric OTTL function to transform processor (#22853)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Don't drop histograms without buckets (#22070)
- `pkg/ottl`: Add a new Function Getter to the OTTL package, to allow passing Converters as literal parameters. (#22961)
  Currently OTTL provides no way to use any defined Converter within another Editor/Converter.
  Although Converters can be passed as a parameter, they are always executed and the result is what is actually passed as the parameter.
  This allows OTTL to pass Converters themselves as a parameter so they can be executed within the function.
  
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: GCP resource detection processor can automatically add `gcp.gce.instance.hostname` and `gcp.gce.instance.name` attributes. (#24598)
- `splunkhecexporter`: Add heartbeat check while startup and new config param, heartbeat/startup (defaults to false). This is different than the healtcheck_startup, as the latter doesn't take token or index into account. (#24411)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Report  logical and physical number of CPUs as metric. (#22099)
  Use the `system.cpu.logical.count::enabled` and `system.cpu.physical.count::enabled` flags to enable them
  
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Allows disabling metrics and resource attributes (#24568)
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Reduce memory utilization (#24769)
- `k8sattributes`: Added k8s.cluster.uid to k8sattributes processor to add cluster uid (#21974)

- `filelogreceiver`: Bump 'filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing' feature gate to beta (#18198)
- `receiver/purefareceiver`: implement the custom label `fa_array_name` to act as a pretty label for metrics received. (#23889, #21248, #22027)
- `receiver/prometheusreceiver`: Add config `report-extra-scrape-metrics` to report additional prometheus scraping metrics (#21040)
  Emits additional metrics - scrape_body_size_bytes, scrape_sample_limit, scrape_timeout_seconds. scrape_body_size_bytes metric can be used for checking failed scrapes due to body-size-limit.
- `receiver/sqlquery`: Set ObservedTimestamp on collected logs (#23776)
- `exporter/awss3exporter`: Allow custom endpoints to be configured for exporting spans (#21833)
- `cmd/telemetrygen`: Add ability to set custom path to endpoint. (#24551)

- `webhookreceiver`: Add an optional config setting to set a required header that all incoming requests must provide (#24270)
- `extension/jaegerremotesampling`: gRPC remote source usage in jaegerremotesampling extension propagates HTTP headers if set in gRPC client config (#24414)
- `extension/jaegerremotesampling`: gRPC remote source usage in jaegerremotesampling extension supports optional caching via existing `reload_interval` config (#24840)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `receiver/sshcheck`: Add the SSH endpoint as a resource attribute (#24441)
- `awsemfexporter`: Enforce time to live on metric data that is stored for the purpose of cumulative to delta conversions within EMF Exporter (#25058)
  This change fixes a bug where the cache used to store metric information for cumulative to delta
  conversions was not enforcing its time to live. This could cause excessive memory growth in certain scenarios which could
  lead to OOM failures for Collector. To properly fix this issue package global metric caches were removed and replaced
  with caches that are unique per emf exporter. A byproduct of this change is that no two emf exporters within an 
  Collector will share a caches leading to more accurate cumulative to delta conversions. 
  
- `awsemfexporter`: Add retain_initial_value_of_delta_metric to translateOTelToGroupedMetric, allowing the initial set of metrics to be published (#24051)
- `carbonreceiver`: Fix Carbon receiver obsrecv operations memory leak (#24275)
  The carbonreceiver has a memory leak where it will repeatedly open new obsrecv operations but not close them afterwards. Those operations eventually create a burden.
  
  The fix is to make sure the receiver only creates an operation per interaction over TCP.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Populate OTLP resource attributes in Datadog logs. Changes mapping for `jvm.loaded_classes` from `process.runtime.jvm.classes.loaded` to `process.runtime.jvm.classes.current_loaded`. (#24674)
- `datadogexporter`: Fix the population of Datadog `system.*` metrics. Ensure the average is within [min, max] in histograms. (#25071)
  The minimum and maximum estimation is only used when the minimum and maximum are not available in the OTLP payload or this is a cumulative payload.
- `pkg/stanza`: Create a new decoder for each TCP/UDP connection to prevent concurrent write to buffer. (#24980)
- `exporter/kafkaexporter`: Fixes a panic when SASL configuration is not present (#24797)
- `lokitranslator, lokiexporter`: Fixes a panic that occurred during the promotion of nested attributes containing dots to labels (#25125)
- `awsxrayexporter`: Fix X-Ray Segment status code and exception translations. (#24381)
- `receiver/haproxy`: Make sure emitted resource metrics have distinct resources by default (#24921)
  This is done by enabling and renaming the following resource attributes:
    - proxy_name -> haproxy.proxy_name
    - service_name -> haproxy.service_name
  
- `receiver/k8sobjects`: Fix bug where duplicate data would be ingested for watch mode if the client connection got reset. (#24806)
- `datadogreceiver`: Fixed NPE on failed to decode message path (#24562)
- `zipkinreceiver`: Respects zipkin's serialised status tags to be converted to span status (#14965)
- `datadogexporter`: Correctly set metrics exporter capabilities to state that it mutates data (#24908)
  This could lead to random panics if using more than one metrics exporter.
  
- `processor/resourcedetection`: Do not drop all system attributes if `host.id` cannot be fetched. (#24669)
- `signalfxexporter`: convert vmpage_io* translated metrics to pages (#25064)
- `splunkhecreceiver`: aligns success resp body w/ splunk enterprise (#19219)
  changes resp from plaintext "ok" to json {"text"："success", "code"：0}

## v0.82.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `receiver/awsfirehose`: Change the type of `Config.AccessKey` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/cloudfoundry`: Change the type of `Config.UAA.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `exporter/datasetexporter`: Remove temporary client side attribute aggregation and corresponding traces.max_wait and traces.aggregate config options which are now redundant. (#20660)
  This pull request removes the following attributes from the DataSet trace events: services, 
  span_count, error_count. Those attributes were populated on the client side as part of the client
  side aggregation code. This client side aggregation was meant as a temporary solution until a
  proper solution is implement on the server side. Being a temporary solution meant it had many
  edge cases and would only work under specific and limited circumstances (all spans which belong
  to a trace are part of the same batch received by the plugin).
  
  Corresponding config options (traces.aggregate and traces.max_wait) which are not redundant and
  unused have also been removed.
  
- `mysqlreceiver`: removing `mysql.locked_connects` metric which is replaced by `mysql.connection.errors` (#23211)
- `pkg/ottl`: Allow access to the metrics slice in the metric context (#24446)
  This is only a breaking change for users using OTTL in custom components. For all Contrib components this is an enhancement.
- `pkg/stanza`: Make fileconsumer.PositionalScanner internal (#23999)
- `pkg/stanza`: Make fileconsumer.Fingerprint internal (#23998)
- `receiver/httpcheck`: Fail fast on endpoint missing scheme (#23020)
  Previously, when configured with an endpoint without HTTP/HTTPS scheme like "opentelemetry.io",
  the receiver would start correctly, but fail to check the endpoint, producing the `httpcheck.error`
  metric on every collection interval. After this change, the receiver fails to start, writing
  an error log saying that you need to provide a scheme in the endpoint.
  
- `receiver/jmx`: Change the types of `Config.{Password,KeystorePassword,TruststorePassword}` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `httpcheckreceiver`: support scraping multiple targets (#18823)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Disable `host.id` by default on the `system` detector. This restores the behavior prior to v0.72.0 when using the `system` detector together with other detectors that set `host.id` (#21233)
  To re-enable `host.id` on the `system` detector set `system::resource_attributes::host.id::enabled` to `true`:  
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```
  
- `receiver/nsxt`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/podman`: Change the type of `Config.SSHPassphrase` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/postgresql`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `prometheusreciever`: Remove unused buffer_period and buffer_count configuration options (#24258)
- `prometheusreceiver`: Add the `trim_metric_suffixes` configuration option to allow enable metric suffix trimming. (#21743, #8950)
  When enabled, suffixes for unit and type are trimmed from metric names. 
  If you previously enabled the `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` 
  feature gate, you will need to enable this option to have suffixes trimmed.
  
- `receiver/pulsar`: Change the types of `Config.Authentication.Token.Token` and `Config.Authentication.Athenz.PrivateKey` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/rabbitmq`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/redis`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/riak`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/saphana`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/snmp`: Change the types of the `Config.{AuthPassword,PrivacyPassword}` fields to be of `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/snowflake`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `receiver/solace`: Change the type of `Config.Auth.PlainText.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Histograms will not have exemplars by default (#23872)
  Previously spanmetricsconnector would attach every single span as an exemplar to the histogram.
  Exemplars are now disabled by default. To enable them set `exemplars::enabled=true`
  
- `receiver/vcenter`: Change the type of `Config.Password` to be `configopaque.String` (#17273)

- `datadogexporter`: Source resolution logic now runs all source providers in parallel to improve start times. (#24234)
  All source providers now run in all environments so you may see more spurious logs from downstream dependencies when using the Datadog exporter. These logs should be safe to ignore.
  
- `datadogexporter`: Add support for reporting host metadata from remote hosts. (#24290)
  Resource attributes for each telemetry signal will be used for host metadata if the 'datadog.host.use_as_metadata' boolean attribute is set to 'true'.

- `processor/resourcedetection`: Fix docker detector not setting any attributes. (#24280)
- `processor/resourcedetection`: Fix Heroku config option for the `service.name` and `service.version` attributes (#24355)
  `service.name` and `service.version` attributes were mistakenly controlled by `heroku.app.name` and
  `heroku.release.version` options under `resource_attributes` configuration introduced in 0.81.0. 
  This PR fixes the issue by using the correct config options named the same as the attributes.
- `processor/resourcedetection`: make sure to use a aks config struct instead of nil to avoid collector panic (#24549)
- `filelogreceiver`: Fix issue where files were deduplicated unnecessarily (#24235)
- `processor/tailsamplingprocessor`: Fix data race when accessing spans during policies evaluation (#24283)

- `dockerstatsreceiver`: Add non populated metrics `container.memory.anon` and `container.memory.file` that are only available when the host uses cgroups v2. (#21097)
  Metric `container.memory.file` was added to fulfil the lack of `container.memory.total_cache` metric in case that the
  cgroup version mounted in the host is v2 instead of v1.
  
  Now there is documentation of which metrics are available depending cgroups version being used on the host.
  

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `mysqlreceiver`: set `mysql.locked_connects` as optional in order to remove it in next release (#14138, #23274)

### 💡 Enhancements 💡

- `mdatagen`: Adds a parent field to metadata.yaml for subcomponents. (#23636)
- `sqlqueryreceiver`: Add support of Start and End Timestamp Column in Metric Configuration. (#18925, #14146)
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Adds unit to metrics where this was missing. (#23571)
  Affected metrics can be found below.
  - postgresql.bgwriter.maxwritten
  - postgresql.table.count

- `googlecloudexporter`: Adds an experimental, opt-in write ahead log for GCP metrics exporter. (#23679)
- `pkg/ottl`: Adds new `Time` converter to convert a string to a Golang time struct based on a supplied format (#22007)
- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Add new Windows-exclusive process.handles metric. (#21379)
- `websocketprocessor`: Rename websocketprocessor to remoteobserverprocessor (#23856)
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Adds a way to configure the list of added resource attributes by the processor (#21482)
  Users can now configure what resource attributes are gathered by specific detectors.
  Example configuration:
  
  ```
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [system, ec2]
    system:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: true
        host.id:
          enabled: false
    ec2:
      resource_attributes:
        host.name:
          enabled: false
        host.id:
          enabled: true
  ```
  
  For example, this config makes `host.name` being set by `system` detector, and `host.id` by `ec2` detector.
  Moreover:
  - Existing behavior remains unaffected as all attributes are currently enabled by default.
  - The default attributes 'enabled' values are defined in `metadata.yaml`.
  - Future releases will introduce changes to resource_attributes `enabled` values.
  - Users can tailor resource detection process to their needs and environment.
  
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Added disabling options for histogram metrics and option to exclude default labels from all metrics. In some cases users want to optionally disable part of metrics because they generate too much data or are not needed. (#16344)
- `statsdreceiver`: All receivers are setting receiver name and version when sending data. This change introduces the same behaviour to the statsd receiver. (#23563)
- `zookeeperreceiver`: Adds an additional health check metric based off of the response from the zookeeper ruok 4lw command. (#21481)
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Switch k8s.pod and k8s.container metrics to use pdata. (#23441)

### 🧰 Bug fixes 🧰

- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Add back all other vendor-specific node conditions, and report them even if missing, as well as all allocatable node metrics if present,  to the list of Kubernetes node metrics available, which went missing during the pdata translation (#23839)
- `k8sclusterreceiver`: Add explicitly `k8s.node.allocatable_pods` to the list of Kubernetes node metrics available, which went missing during the pdata translation (#23839)

## v0.80.0

### 🛑 Breaking changes 🛑

- `redisreceiver`: Updates metric unit from no unit to Bytes. (#23454)
  Affected metrics can be found below.
  - redis.clients.max_input_buffer
  - redis.clients.max_output_buffer
  - redis.replication.backlog_first_byte_offset
  - redis.replication.offset
  
- `elasticsearchreceiver`: Bump 'receiver.elasticsearch.emitNodeVersionAttr' to stable (#16847)
  All node metrics are now enriched with the node version resource attribute.
- `nginxreceiver`: Bump 'receiver.nginx.emitConnectionsCurrentAsSum' featuregate to beta (enabled by default) (#4326)
- `servicegraphprocessor`: Change metric names to match the spec (#18743, #16578)
  Latency metric `traces_service_graph_request_duration_seconds` are deprecated in favor of server and client metrics | `traces_service_graph_server_request_seconds` and `traces_service_graph_client_request_seconds` | respectively. Use the feature gate `processor.servicegraph.legacyLatencyMetricNames` to enable the old metric names.
- `prometheusreceiver, prometheusexporter, prometheusremotewrite`: Disable `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` feature gate by default (#23208)
  The feature gate `pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` was enabled prematurely while translation
  on the prometheus receiver was incomplete. To address this, the feature gate has been reverted back to alpha status.
  This will remain the case until the translation on the receiver side aligns with the translation on the exporter side,
  or until it is replaced with a configuration option or completely removed. To maintain the current behavior, you can
  enable the feature gate using the `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName` command argument. 
  However, please note that the translation in the prometheus receiver is a subject to future changes.

  This is only a breaking change for users using OTTL in custom components. For all Contrib components this is an enhancement.
- `postgresqlreceiver`: Remove resource attribute feature gates (#22479)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `dockerstatsreceiver`: cpu.container.percent metric will be deprecated in v0.79.0 in favor of container.cpu.utilization (#21807)

  and replacing it with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:
  - `container.cpu.percent`
  At this stage, the new metric is added, but is disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Docker Stats receiver's README for details.

  The compression used to be enabled only if the payload size was greater than 1.5KB which significantly
  complicated the logic and made it hard to test. This change makes the compression unconditionally applied to 
  the payload if it's enabled in the config. The benchmarking shows improvements in the throughput and CPU usage for 
  large payloads and expected degradation for small payloads which is acceptable given that it's not a common case.

- `journaldreceiver`: add support for `matches` configuration (#20295)
- `fileexporter`: Add periodic flushing (#18251)
  Adding flushing to the file exporter eases the analysis
  of the output the exporter generates.

  Add a `retry_on_failure` config option (disabled by default) that can be used to slow down reading logs instead of 
  dropping logs if downstream components return a non-permanent error. The configuration has the following options:
    - `enabled`: Enable or disable the retry mechanism. Default is `false`.
    - `initial_interval`: The initial interval to wait before retrying. Default is `1s`.
    - `max_interval`: The maximum interval to wait before retrying. Default is `30s`.
    - `max_elapsed_time`: The maximum amount of time to wait before giving up. Default is `5m`.

- `receiver/mongodbatlasreceiver`: emit "`mongodb_atlas.user.alias`" attribute which is the user-friendly hostname of the cluster node as displayed in the Atlas portal. This attribute is disabled by default, if you want to emit it, you'll need to explicitly enable it. (#18881)
- `prometheusreceiver`: All receivers are setting receiver name and version when sending data. This change introduces the same behaviour to the prometheus receiver. (#20902)
- `splunkhecexporter`: Adding an option in splunkhecexporter to enable heartbeat. A heartbeat is a metadata event about the current environment and build information. If heartbeat is enabled, splunkhecexporter will periodically send heartbeat to the destination in given time intervals from configurations. (#20225)

  This change affects all processors that use OTTL (i.e. `transformprocessor`, `routingprocessor`, and `filterprocessor`).
  This is a breaking change in the rare scenario that the `$` character is currently used in a replacement string.
  To output a literal `$` in a replacement string it must now be escaped with an additional `$`.
- `resourcedetectionprocessor`: Bump OpenShift semconv version from 1.16.0 to 1.18.0. (#19168)
  Rename google openshift platform attribute from google_cloud_openshift to gcp_openshift.
- `spanmetricsconnector`: Drop Prometheus-specific metrics labels sanitization. (#18678)
  The spanmeterics connector is the OTel component, therefore, we would
  like to strip Prometheus-specific parts from it. Metric names and attributes
  conversion to Prometheus conventions should happen in Prometheus components,
  e.g. Prometheus Remote Write exporter.
  

### 🚀 New components 🚀

- `filereceiver`: Add basic file reading capabilities to file receiver. Second PR. (#14638)

- `exporter/prometheus`: Produce exemplars for monotonic sum metrics (i.e. counters in Prometheus) when available (#18201)
  This could be a breaking change if you already have enabled OpenMetrics format for the Prometheus exporter and have enabled exemplar ingestion in your Prometheus scraper.  To ensure names and types are generated correctly according to the OpenMetrics conventions, you should run your collector with `--feature-gates=pkg.translator.prometheus.NormalizeName`
- `filelogreceiver`: Adds ability to parse a file header and parse it as metadata to decorate log entries. (#18198)

- `k8sattributesprocessor`: Default `container.id` to latest instance unless `k8s.container.restart_count` is specified (#16432)
- `mdatagen`: Turn on the ability to enable/disable resource attributes by embedding MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings into all scraping receivers as MetricsBuilderConfig (#16373)
  Currently, the only way to add configurative functionality to mdatagen is by using a bunch of WithResourceAttributesSettings options to the constructor.
  This PR changes the first argument to the NewMetricsBuilder constructor to be of type MetricsBuilderConfig,
  which is a new class that wraps both MetricsSettings and ResourceAttributesSettings, and may be (hopefully) easily extended with more
  configuration in the future.

- `prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export `_created` metric for Summary, Histogram and Monotonic Sum metric points if `StartTimeUnixNano` is set. (#17412, #12426)
  The export of tbe `_created` metric is configurable in the Prometheus remote write exporter. It is disabled by default.
- `clickhouseexporter`: Fix "no such host" error when the DSN hostname contains the database name (#16476)
- `oracledbreceiver`: the resource attribute `oracledb.instance.name` now captures the database name. (#17850)

  If the `_created` metric was present in the Histogram, Summary or Counter
  metric family, only then its values is used to set `StartTimeUnixNano` on the
  relevant OTLP metric and dropped afterwards. Otherwise, it is converted to the
  monotonic OTLP Sum metric.
  This behaviour is disabled by default. Use the `receiver.prometheusreceiver.UseCreatedMetric`
  to enable it.
  
- `exporter/prometheusremotewriteexporter`: Export exemplars for the Monotonic Sum metric. (#17573)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fix panic that can occur when event is larger than current buffer size. (#17879)
- `windowseventlogreceiver`: Fixed a panic that could create an empty buffer due to incorrect use of unsafe pointers in syscall. (#17878)
  Fixed a potential panic due to a syscall indicating a that the event buffer should resize to 0. The next used of that resized buffer would result in an index out of bounds panic.
  
  Also, added a safety check for buffer resize cases that if the syscall indicates it needs the buffer size to be 0, an error will be returned.

  The design of the converter is opaque and its behavior may change in the future.
  Because of this, the `converter` settings are deemed unstable. The actual behavior of the
  converter remains unchanged, but will always use the former default values.

- `exporter/googlemanagedprometheusexporter`: Moved ClientConfig under MetricConfig, and added an option to change the default metric name prefix for advanced use cases. (#10543)
- `pkg/ottl`: Update `ExprFunc`, `Set`, and `Get` to all return errors. (#15649)

Rename the config resource_attributes to resource_attrs_included. Build in-house logic in the tanzuobservability exporter and remove the usage of resourcetotelemetry. (#14733)

### 🚩 Deprecations 🚩

- `hostmetricsreceiver`: Introduce renamed process memory metrics (#14327)
  This starts the process of phasing out incorrect metric names:

  - `process.memory.physical_usage`

  and replacing them with the names adhering to the semantic conventions:

  - `process.memory.usage`
  - `process.memory.virtual`

  At this stage, the new metrics are added, but they are disabled by default.
  See the "Deprecations" section of the Host Metrics receiver's README for details.

    - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io` will become:
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.received`
      - `elasticsearch.node.cluster.io.sent`
- `kubeletstatsreceiver`: Remove direction for metrics. The feature gate: receiver.kubeletstatsreceiver.emitMetricsWithoutDirectionAttribute can be set to apply the following (#12588) (#12164)

    2. Recognizing the "host.name" resource attribute and using that
    value to fill in log metadata recognized upstream.

    This is a breaking change, and as such will generate a startup
    error if the exporter is configured to send to an endpoint that
    does not support this feature.
