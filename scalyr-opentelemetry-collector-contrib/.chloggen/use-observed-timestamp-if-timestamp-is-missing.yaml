subtext:
  Some OpenTelemetry libraries do not send timestamp for logs, but they should always send
  | the observed timestamp. In these cases the ClickHouse exporter just stored a zero timestamp
  | to the database. This changes the behavior to look into the observed timestamp if the timestamp
  | is zero.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with [chore] or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
change_logs: [user]
