  With this change, UUIDv7 is recommended for the OpAMP extension's instance_uid field instead of ULID. ULIDs will continue to work, but may be displayed as UUIDs.
  The supervisor's persistent state (${storage_dir}/persistent_state.yaml) will need to be cleared to generate a new UUIDv7 instead of a ULID.
  This change may be incompatible with management servers using v0.14.0 of opamp-go.
